# Garment_Worker_Productivity_Regression
This project predicts garment worker productivity using machine learning techniques. By analyzing production attributes like overtime, incentives, and worker count, we develop accurate models to assist manufacturers in improving workforce management and operational efficiency. Multiple regression models are evaluated for performance.
